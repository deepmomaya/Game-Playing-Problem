# Game-Playing-Problem

This Red-Blue Nim game is a modified version of the classic nim game, where players take turns removing marbles from two piles: red and blue. The objective is to be the last player to remove a marble from a pile which is becoming empty. Each player can only remove one marble at a time from either pile. The winner is determined by the number of marbles left, with red marbles and blue marbles being worth some points.
